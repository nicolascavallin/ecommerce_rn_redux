# Code Challenge

## What is that?

A simple e-commerce mobile app, using:

- React Native CLI
- TypeScript
- Redux (with Redux Toolkit)
- Reanimated
- React Navigation (with the Native Stack Navigation)
- And other libraries such as FastImage, dayjs and @gorhom/bottom-sheet

## How to run

1. Go into project folder and run
   `npm install`

### For iOS (only on macOS)

2. Then run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
3. Finally run `npm run ios`

### For Android

2. Be sure that you have your `local.properties` file in `android` folder.
3. Finally run `npm run android`

> I'm assuming you have some experience coding, and you have Xcode (in the case of macOS), and Android Studio installed. Also, you must have `node.js` on your machine.
